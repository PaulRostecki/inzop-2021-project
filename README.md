# inzop-2021-project
This repository contains a group project, **E-dzienniczek**, made for [2021/2022 Software Engineering](https://usosweb.amu.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2%2Fprzedmioty%2FpokazPrzedmiot&kod=06-DINOLI0&lang=en) course at [Adam Mickiewicz University](https://amu.edu.pl/en), which is a part of the curriculum of the Computer Science programme at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://wmi.amu.edu.pl/en)

The goal of this project was to familiarize students with a workflow that is common throughout IT, which is cooperating in a project group, being divided into specific roles, as well as using Agile methodology and Jira-like project management software to organize the team's work.

# Project
The projects is generally a desktop app written in Java for managing students at a university. Its functionalities are:
- Adding and deleting students, lecturers, groups, courses
- Adding and editing grades by a lecturer
- Display content: timetable, grades, groups, user information
- Send/receive announcements

Additionally, there is a [website](https://edzienniczek.netlify.app/) written in React, which lists in more detail: the whole stack, team, functionalities and allows to contact the team via the contact form.

# Technologies
Desktop app, which is the main part of the project, was written in **Java**. It also uses **PostgreSQL** database, which is deployed using **Docker**, to store the data. Our website was written in **React**. Some of the scripts have been written in **Python** and **Bash** as well.

As this project was meant to be an introduction to working in real development teams, we also used [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/), which is an open-source alternative to Jira, to organize our work.
